Hi! My name is Jason, and I am a Data Scientist at XiFin Inc. I am also pursuing a Masters of Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley. 

I have a professional background in data science and machine learning. I received my B.S. in Data Science from UC San Diego, and currently I work as a Data Scientist. At XiFin, I work on ML and AI models to improve the healthcare billing process for both patients and payors. 

I'm interested in applying ML and AI in many different fields, ranging from fraud detection, healthcare, ethics, space exploration, and more. Outside of data science, my interests include hiking/backpacking, cooking, playing board games/card games, photography, and reading.
